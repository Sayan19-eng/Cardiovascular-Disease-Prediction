# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction

Cardiovascular disease is a broad category for a range of diseases that are affecting heart and blood vessels. The early methods of forecasting cardiovascular diseases helped in making decisions about the changes to have occurred in high-risk patients which resulted in the reduction of their risks. The health care industry contains lots of medical data, therefore machine learning algorithms are required to make decisions effectively in the prediction of heart diseases. Recent research has delved into uniting these techniques to provide hybrid machine learning algorithms.

 In the proposed research, data pre-processing uses techniques like the removal of noisy data, removal of missing data, filling default values if applicable, and classification of attributes for prediction and decision making at different levels. 

 The performance of the diagnosis model is obtained by using methods like classification, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity analysis. This project proposes a prediction model to predict whether people have heart disease or not and to provide awareness or diagnosis on that.

 This is done by comparing the accuracies of applying rules to the individual results of Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Naive Bayes classifier, and logistic regression on the dataset taken in a region to present an accurate model of predicting cardiovascular disease.
